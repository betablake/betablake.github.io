                Although I have held many different roles and had a variety of responsibilities throughout my career, my commitment to lifelong learning and my advocacy for the use of technology has never ceased. From the moment I graduated from my bachelor's degree program through the present, I have sought to learn more about technology, use technology to inform others, and teach about the proper use of technology. After graduating with a degree in marketing in 2013, I began working at an online retailer working on website projects. In this role I spent a portion of my time receiving training on the content management system used to populate and manage the shopping site. Along with this, I trained in new employees on internal company technologies and tools.

                In my next position, my passion for technology grew and my educational skills were honed. I began working as a project manager at a company that sold a meeting room booking app to other organizations. The two types of projects I worked on truly exemplified my split passions of education and technology. From the technology side, I spearheaded website development projects for the company’s commercial website. Regarding education, I also directed implementation projects for new customers and taught their employees how to use our software. The training included pre-recorded video demonstrations where I first utilized technology to truly enhance my instructional capabilities.

            <p class="indented">
                From there, I pivoted to technology hardware and worked for an organization that sold in a tiered distribution model. This meant that our customers were sales organizations across the globe that provided their customers with our products along with complimentary services. In this role I again had a dual focus of technology and education. I trained our customers’ sales staff on the benefits and technical components of our hardware and worked with partners to manage intranet and commercial microsites for our products.

            <p class="indented blueBox">
                My next place of employment provided me with the opportunity for the direct intersection of my two passions of education and technology. I began working at another application development company that sold their proprietary software to other organizations. In this role I taught end users how to use the application and consulted on best practices for technology management with customers. I even went so far as to design a new product for the organization that was sold to current customers. It was at this time that I recognized my desire to further my education and dive deeper into learning technologies. I began taking courses in the Master of Science of Learning Technology and Design Program part time.

            <h3>The Present</h3>
            <p class="indented">
                My current role is a slight shift of my dual passions of technology and education. I work as a Scrum Master for an application development team. This provides me with the opportunity to teach and guide my team on the best practices regarding Agile and Scrum methodologies. As I get closer to graduation, I realize how much of my career was shaped by education and technology and I hope to continue with my passion for both endeavors.
