                    The four competencies that my projects demonstrate are: “Develop Learning Systems Apps,” “Design Learning Environments,” “Learn Best Practices for Needs Assessment, Task Analysis, and Course Design and Development,” and “Understand Usability, User Experience, New Technology and Communication.” A video game prototype is the project that embodies “Develop Learning Systems Apps” during my coursework at the University of Missouri. A full video game created for a research project at the University of Missouri shows my competence in the “Design Learning Environments” category. For the “Learn Best Practices for Needs Assessment, Task Analysis, and Course Design and Development” category, I chose an Ask System microsite that was built for a course. Lastly, a point and click video game illustrates the competency of “Understand Usability, User Experience, New Technology and Communication.”

                    <h3>8-Bit Cleanup</h3>
                    <p>
                        This game is one of the very first projects I created while attending the University of Missouri. The title is “8-Bit Cleanup” and it is a learning game prototype designed to teach players what types of materials are recyclable and which materials should be thrown in the trash. The player character is an unnamed gun slinger that can either shoot to recycle the enemy or trash the enemy. Each type of bullet is associated with a different color and shape to help the player to identify when they are choosing to trash or recycle. The enemies have corresponding material types that can only be defeated if hit with the appropriate bullet on how to dispose of that type of material. For example, the Plastic Jellyfish enemy can only be defeated by shooting it with the recycle bullet. Players advance through the game by defeating enemies to collect points and platform jumping to the exit door of each level. At the end of each level, the player is notified of the number of enemies hit with the incorrect bullet type vs the correct bullet type. For example, if a player first shoots a trash bullet at the Plastic Jellyfish enemy and then hits the Plastic Jellyfish enemy with a recycle bullet, their score would one correct shot out of two shots. This feedback, accompanied by other game mechanics and tutorial text, provides the main learning mechanic for the game.

                    <p>
                        This game exemplifies the competency of “Develop Learning Systems Apps” as it is a crafted experience with the intention of teaching a set of goals using technology. The goal of the game is to teach players what materials can or cannot be recycled. The technologies used to create and deliver this game are a game engine, a web hosting provider, and a web browser. The game engine I used is called Construct 3 and I hosted the game on my personal site through the provider Dreamhost. The game mechanics are the strongest piece of the project as it is immediately evident to the player if the material shot is recyclable or not.

                    <p>
                        The main weakness of the project is the refinement of the design of the game. Both the level design and the game’s art assets are not very polished and leave something to be desired in terms of usability. While I favor solving problems and building mechanics to creating art assets, I learned in this project that solid learning applications require both function and form to really nail the usability element. I would spend more time sourcing free or low-cost artwork if I had to redo this project from scratch. Lastly, this is simply a prototype of a game. It truly needs more than four levels to be considered a full-fledged learning experience and game.

                    <h3>Stories of a GeoFarmer</h3>
                    <p>
                        This game was developed in conjunction with Dr. Danielle Oprean and Dr. Soren Larsen as a part of the GEOG 1200 course discussion during modules 13 through 16. The game focuses on the South and East Asia portion of the course. Stories of a GeoFarmer is a Role-Playing Game that utilizes non-player character (NPC) interaction and a farming simulation mechanic to guide students through the nuances of sustainable agricultural geography and societal, economic, and cultural forces.  Players traverse through Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines to learn about farming through harvesting crops and working with residents to stimulate the local economy. Players complete quests to progress through the different locales and gain inventory and currency for their farms.

                    <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stories of a GeoFarmer was intended to be a somewhat self-contained learning environment. The majority of the concepts were intended to be taught or reinforced strictly within the context of the game. Tools within the game would then supplement the learning environment with activities to truly imprint the lessons upon the players. Being a pseudo self-contained learning environment is both a strength and a weakness of this design. Not having to rely on external texts or lessons provides the game the ability to truly engross the player in verisimilitude and prevents any issues of miscommunication between mediums teaching the same concepts. However, forcing all the concepts into one learning environment also puts a heavy burden on the game and the design can suffer from that burden.

                    <p>
                        The player interactions with the non-player characters can feel contrived at times and the quests are not as engaging as they could be. Along with the limitations brought about from the design of the game, the game engine used to create the game also provides limitations. RPG Maker is the game engine for Stories of a GeoFarmer. It speeds up production of the levels and interactable objects with the no-code components of the engine but comes with a large amount of overhead just to create custom interactions and scripts. The artwork that is preloaded into the game is also a heavy limitation of the game engine. After reviewing student feedback, we learned that more representative artwork and a clearer goal for players would provide a better experience. We are currently working with a graphic designer to create representative artwork. Along with this, a redesign of the interaction mechanics and deeper integration of the farming mechanic are being worked on.

                    <h3>Ask System - Build a PC</h3>
                    <p>This microsite is an “Ask System” that allows users to peruse questions and learn about the answers regarding building a gaming personal computer (PC). The intent of such a system is to provide detailed knowledge on building a PC as well as answer any questions that an individual may have on the topic. This type of system is meant to reflect the way a conversation with an expert on the subject matter might proceed. The user can “ask” the site questions by clicking on the desired section and delve deeper into the subject until the question is answered.  The ask system is designed for individuals new to the practice of building a gaming PC.</p>

                    <p>
                        The “Ask System” was designed after researching the steps to create a personal computer (PC) and evaluating the tasks required to fulfill the task. This system was created using basic web development techniques, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding, and incorporated a style library known as Bootstrap to speed up development and enhance usability. The fundamental components to building a gaming PC as well as common difficulties experienced by users were included in the system. The navigational elements are very straightforward and easy to follow for the users. A simple sidebar navigation provides quick access to each topic and the ability to quickly dive deeper into topics via nested links. While the navigation is a strength of the system, it is only able to have such easy navigation due to the limited content available.

                    <p>
                        The biggest downside of the microsite is the lack of content and instruction on the subject. Along with this, there is limited interactivity to provide a similar feeling to having a conversation with an expert. My main takeaway from this project is that the level of complexity needed to cover a topic comprehensively is much higher than I assumed. I would choose a smaller scope for the “Ask System” or perhaps create a series of smaller systems that were on the subject matter in order to provide more value by covering enough information on the topic to be usable.
