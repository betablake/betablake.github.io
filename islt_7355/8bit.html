                <p>
                    This game is one of the very first projects I created while attending the University of Missouri. The title is “8-Bit Cleanup” and it is a learning game prototype designed to teach players what types of materials are recyclable and which materials should be thrown in the trash. The player character is an unnamed gun slinger that can either shoot to recycle the enemy or trash the enemy. Each type of bullet is associated with a different color and shape to help the player to identify when they are choosing to trash or recycle. The enemies have corresponding material types that can only be defeated if hit with the appropriate bullet on how to dispose of that type of material. For example, the Plastic Jellyfish enemy can only be defeated by shooting it with the recycle bullet. Players advance through the game by defeating enemies to collect points and platform jumping to the exit door of each level. At the end of each level, the player is notified of the number of enemies hit with the incorrect bullet type vs the correct bullet type. For example, if a player first shoots a trash bullet at the Plastic Jellyfish enemy and then hits the Plastic Jellyfish enemy with a recycle bullet, their score would one correct shot out of two shots. This feedback, accompanied by other game mechanics and tutorial text, provides the main learning mechanic for the game.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    This game exemplifies the competency of “Develop Learning Systems Apps” as it is a crafted experience with the intention of teaching a set of goals using technology. The goal of the game is to teach players what materials can or cannot be recycled. The technologies used to create and deliver this game are a game engine, a web hosting provider, and a web browser. The game engine I used is called Construct 3 and I hosted the game on my personal site through the provider Dreamhost. The game mechanics are the strongest piece of the project as it is immediately evident to the player if the material shot is recyclable or not.

                <p>
                    The main weakness of the project is the refinement of the design of the game. Both the level design and the game’s art assets are not very polished and leave something to be desired in terms of usability. While I favor solving problems and building mechanics to creating art assets, I learned in this project that solid learning applications require both function and form to really nail the usability element. I would spend more time sourcing free or low-cost artwork if I had to redo this project from scratch. Lastly, this is simply a prototype of a game. It truly needs more than four levels to be considered a full-fledged learning experience and game.
