            <h3>Purpose, Goals, and Objectives</h3>
            <p>
                This website was created to highlight both the core competencies gained as a part of the Master of Science (MS) of Learning Technologies and Design (LTD) program as well as demonstrate my capabilities as a developer, designer, and instructor. To that end, the website includes three projects I have created that exemplify a specific competency for the program. Each project is accompanied by a visual, a reflection, and a description. Along with the projects, a reflection illuminates my views and personal philosophy. Through the projects included and reflections, this website aims to show my personal and professional growth attained through the MS of LTD program.
