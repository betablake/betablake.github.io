                <p>
                    This game was developed in conjunction with Dr. Danielle Oprean and Dr. Soren Larsen as a part of the GEOG 1200 course discussion during modules 13 through 16. The game focuses on the South and East Asia portion of the course. Stories of a GeoFarmer is a Role-Playing Game that utilizes non-player character (NPC) interaction and a farming simulation mechanic to guide students through the nuances of sustainable agricultural geography and societal, economic, and cultural forces.  Players traverse through Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines to learn about farming through harvesting crops and working with residents to stimulate the local economy. Players complete quests to progress through the different locales and gain inventory and currency for their farms.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                Stories of a GeoFarmer was intended to be a somewhat self-contained learning environment. The majority of the concepts were intended to be taught or reinforced strictly within the context of the game. Tools within the game would then supplement the learning environment with activities to truly imprint the lessons upon the players. Being a pseudo self-contained learning environment is both a strength and a weakness of this design. Not having to rely on external texts or lessons provides the game the ability to truly engross the player in verisimilitude and prevents any issues of miscommunication between mediums teaching the same concepts. However, forcing all the concepts into one learning environment also puts a heavy burden on the game and the design can suffer from that burden. The player interactions with the non-player characters can feel contrived at times and the quests are not as engaging as they could be. Along with the limitations brought about from the design of the game, the game engine used to create the game also provides limitations. RPG Maker is the game engine for Stories of a GeoFarmer. It speeds up production of the levels and interactable objects with the no-code components of the engine but comes with a large amount of overhead just to create custom interactions and scripts. The artwork that is preloaded into the game is also a heavy limitation of the game engine. After reviewing student feedback, we learned that more representative artwork and a clearer goal for players would provide a better experience. We are currently working with a graphic designer to create representative artwork. Along with this, a redesign of the interaction mechanics and deeper integration of the farming mechanic are being worked on.
