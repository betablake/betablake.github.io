            Hello everyone. My name is Blake and I work as an IT project manager. I work on application development and networking projects primarily. I am currently enrolled in the Master of Science of Learning Technologies and Design program. I have a decent amount of previous development experience. I have developed static websites, designed video games, and worked on other miscellaneous development projects. I have not developed a website in several years and I hope to use this course to refresh myself on HTML and CSS. I also hope to learn about any new developments in HTML5 and CSS3. I hope to be able to apply the skills learned in this course to design my portfolio for graduation. In my free time I am a musician. My wife and I play music together in our spare time. My wife is a pianist, and I am a guitarist.
