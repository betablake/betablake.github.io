                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This microsite is an “Ask System” that allows users to peruse questions and learn about the answers regarding building a gaming personal computer (PC). The intent of such a system is to provide detailed knowledge on building a PC as well as answer any questions that an individual may have on the topic. This type of system is meant to reflect the way a conversation with an expert on the subject matter might proceed. The user can “ask” the site questions by clicking on the desired section and delve deeper into the subject until the question is answered.  The ask system is designed for individuals new to the practice of building a gaming PC.</p>

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    The “Ask System” was designed after researching the steps to create a personal computer (PC) and evaluating the tasks required to fulfill the task. This system was created using basic web development techniques, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding, and incorporated a style library known as Bootstrap to speed up development and enhance usability. The fundamental components to building a gaming PC as well as common difficulties experienced by users were included in the system. The navigational elements are very straightforward and easy to follow for the users. A simple sidebar navigation provides quick access to each topic and the ability to quickly dive deeper into topics via nested links. While the navigation is a strength of the system, it is only able to have such easy navigation due to the limited content available.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest downside of the microsite is the lack of content and instruction on the subject. Along with this, there is limited interactivity to provide a similar feeling to having a conversation with an expert. My main takeaway from this project is that the level of complexity needed to cover a topic comprehensively is much higher than I assumed. I would choose a smaller scope for the “Ask System” or perhaps create a series of smaller systems that were on the subject matter in order to provide more value by covering enough information on the topic to be usable.
